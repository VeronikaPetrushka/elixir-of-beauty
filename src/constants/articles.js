        image: require('../assets/articles/1.png'),
        description: 'Imagine a world without modern creams, shampoos, or makeup. How would you care for yourself 200 years ago? In the early 19th century, beauty rituals were a true art form where nature and creativity worked hand in hand. The ideal of beauty was pale, almost porcelain-like skin. To achieve this, women used masks made from milk, honey, or egg whites, and sometimes even mercury-based creams - dangerous but popular for combating pigmentation. To mattify their faces, they applied rice or flour powder scented with lavender. Luxurious hair required special care. It was washed rarely, using herbal infusions, and jasmine or rose oils were applied for shine. Curls and elegant hairstyles were secured with wax-based mixtures. Makeup was understated. Subtle blush made from carmine added freshness to the face, while lips were tinted with a balm of beetroot and beeswax. The look was completed with refined scents of rose, citrus, or vanilla. These procedures were time-consuming and sophisticated, as beauty has always demanded effort. Which of these past rituals would you try today?'

        description: 'In medieval kingdoms, beauty was not only a gift of nature but also a symbol of high status. Even without modern cosmetics, royal figures found ways to maintain their appearance using natural remedies and knowledge of herbs. Skin cleansing began with herbal infusions. Lavender, rosemary, chamomile, and rose were popular ingredients for washing, as they refreshed and toned the skin. Clay and milk served as the base for masks, which cleansed pores and made the skin softer. To moisturize, royal ladies used creams made from olive or almond oil, enriched with honey or rose water. To avoid tanning, which was considered a sign of common laborers, they applied powders made from chalk or rice. Fragrances were also an essential part of skincare. Mixtures of lavender or sandalwood oil added a pleasant scent to the skin while protecting it from irritation. These natural beauty methods, combining care and harmony with nature, remain relevant even today.'

        description: 'Japanese empresses have long been admired for their porcelain-like skin, which was considered the ideal of beauty. In traditional Japanese culture, skincare was a ritual where every product and action had deep significance. Natural ingredients, carefully gathered from nature, formed the foundation of these practices. Cleansing was key to their skincare routine. Rice water, rich in antioxidants and vitamins, was commonly used to hydrate the skin, leaving it soft and radiant. For deep cleansing, they used azuki powder - ground red beans - that removed impurities and exfoliated the skin. Moisturization was achieved with oils, especially camellia oil, which nourished and protected the skin. To brighten the complexion, empresses applied masks made from pearl powder - a symbol of aristocratic elegance. Green tea, packed with antioxidants, was also used to tone the skin. This drink was not only consumed but also applied topically to revitalize and refresh the skin. These ancient secrets of Japanese empresses continue to inspire modern skincare. Perhaps it`s time to experience their magic for yourself?'

        description: 'In Ancient India, skincare was an essential part of daily life, closely tied to Ayurveda, the ancient Indian system of medicine. Beauty was considered a reflection of inner harmony, so both women and men took care of their skin using natural ingredients that promoted skin health and radiance. The main ingredients for skincare were herbs, oils, and spices. Milk, honey, and turmeric were commonly used to create moisturizing and cleansing masks. Thanks to its anti-inflammatory properties, turmeric helped lighten the skin and combat pigmentation. Oils, particularly coconut and almond oils, were the foundation for moisturizing the skin. They nourished the skin, making it soft and supple. For cleansing, a paste made from rice flour and milk was used, effectively removing impurities. Aromatherapy was also an important part of skincare. Various herbs, such as sandalwood and jasmine, were used to create aromatic oils and balms that moisturize the skin and left a pleasant fragrance. The skincare traditions in Ancient India were based on a deep understanding of nature and harmony with it, allowing people to achieve not only outer beauty but also inner balance. These ancient practices continue to be relevant in modern skincare today.'
